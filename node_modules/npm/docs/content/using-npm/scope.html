<h2 id="scoped-packages">Scoped packages</h2>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>All npm packages have a name. Some package names also have a scope. A scope
follows the usual rules for package names (URL-safe characters, no leading dots
or underscores). When used in package names, scopes are preceded by an <code class="highlighter-rouge">@</code> symbol
and followed by a slash, e.g.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@somescope/somepackagename
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Scopes are a way of grouping related packages together, and also affect a few
things about the way npm treats the package.</p>

<p>Each npm user/organization has their own scope, and only you can add packages
in your scope. This means you donâ€™t have to worry about someone taking your
package name ahead of you. Thus it is also a good way to signal official packages
for organizations.</p>

<p>Scoped packages can be published and installed as of <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm@2</code> and are supported
by the primary npm registry. Unscoped packages can depend on scoped packages and
vice versa. The npm client is backwards-compatible with unscoped registries,
so it can be used to work with scoped and unscoped registries at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="installing-scoped-packages">Installing scoped packages</h3>

<p>Scoped packages are installed to a sub-folder of the regular installation
folder, e.g. if your other packages are installed in <code class="highlighter-rouge">node_modules/packagename</code>,
scoped modules will be installed in <code class="highlighter-rouge">node_modules/@myorg/packagename</code>. The scope
folder (<code class="highlighter-rouge">@myorg</code>) is simply the name of the scope preceded by an <code class="highlighter-rouge">@</code> symbol, and can
contain any number of scoped packages.</p>

<p>A scoped package is installed by referencing it by name, preceded by an
<code class="highlighter-rouge">@</code> symbol, in <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm <span class="nb">install</span> @myorg/mypackage
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or in <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code>:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nl">"dependencies"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"@myorg/mypackage"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"^1.3.0"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that if the <code class="highlighter-rouge">@</code> symbol is omitted, in either case, npm will instead attempt to
install from GitHub; see <a href="/cli-commands/npm-install"><code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install</code></a>.</p>

<h3 id="requiring-scoped-packages">Requiring scoped packages</h3>

<p>Because scoped packages are installed into a scope folder, you have to
include the name of the scope when requiring them in your code, e.g.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">@myorg/mypackage</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is nothing special about the way Node treats scope folders. This
simply requires the <code class="highlighter-rouge">mypackage</code> module in the folder named <code class="highlighter-rouge">@myorg</code>.</p>

<h3 id="publishing-scoped-packages">Publishing scoped packages</h3>

<p>Scoped packages can be published from the CLI as of <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm@2</code> and can be
published to any registry that supports them, including the primary npm
registry.</p>

<p>(As of 2015-04-19, and with npm 2.0 or better, the primary npm registry
<strong>does</strong> support scoped packages.)</p>

<p>If you wish, you may associate a scope with a registry; see below.</p>

<h4 id="publishing-public-scoped-packages-to-the-primary-npm-registry">Publishing public scoped packages to the primary npm registry</h4>

<p>To publish a public scoped package, you must specify <code class="highlighter-rouge">--access public</code> with
the initial publication. This will publish the package and set access
to <code class="highlighter-rouge">public</code> as if you had run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm access public</code> after publishing.</p>

<h4 id="publishing-private-scoped-packages-to-the-npm-registry">Publishing private scoped packages to the npm registry</h4>

<p>To publish a private scoped package to the npm registry, you must have
an <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/private-modules/intro">npm Private Modules</a>
account.</p>

<p>You can then publish the module with <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm publish</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm publish
--access restricted</code>, and it will be present in the npm registry, with
restricted access. You can then change the access permissions, if
desired, with <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm access</code> or on the npmjs.com website.</p>

<h3 id="associating-a-scope-with-a-registry">Associating a scope with a registry</h3>

<p>Scopes can be associated with a separate registry. This allows you to
seamlessly use a mix of packages from the primary npm registry and one or more
private registries, such as npm Enterprise.</p>

<p>You can associate a scope with a registry at login, e.g.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm login <span class="nt">--registry</span><span class="o">=</span>http://reg.example.com <span class="nt">--scope</span><span class="o">=</span>@myco
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Scopes have a many-to-one relationship with registries: one registry can
host multiple scopes, but a scope only ever points to one registry.</p>

<p>You can also associate a scope with a registry using <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm config</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm config <span class="nb">set</span> @myco:registry http://reg.example.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once a scope is associated with a registry, any <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> for a package
with that scope will request packages from that registry instead. Any
<code class="highlighter-rouge">npm publish</code> for a package name that contains the scope will be published to
that registry instead.</p>

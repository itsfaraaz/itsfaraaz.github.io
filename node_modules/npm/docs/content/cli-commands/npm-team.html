<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>Used to manage teams in organizations, and change team memberships. Does not
handle permissions for packages.</p>

<p>Teams must always be fully qualified with the organization/scope they belong to
when operating on them, separated by a colon (<code class="highlighter-rouge">:</code>). That is, if you have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">wombats</code> team in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">wisdom</code> organization, you must always refer to that team as <code class="highlighter-rouge">wisdom:wombats</code> in these commands.</p>

<p>If you have two-factor authentication enabled in <code class="highlighter-rouge">auth-and-writes</code> mode, then you can provide a code from your authenticator with <code class="highlighter-rouge">[--otp &lt;otpcode&gt;]</code>. If you donâ€™t include this then you will be prompted.</p>

<ul>
  <li>create / destroy:
Create a new team, or destroy an existing one. Note: You cannot remove the <code class="highlighter-rouge">developers</code> team, <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/about-developers-team" target="_blank">learn more.</a></li>
  <li>
    <p>add / rm:
Add a user to an existing team, or remove a user from a team they belong to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ls:
If performed on an organization name, will return a list of existing teams
under that organization. If performed on a team, it will instead return a list
of all users belonging to that particular team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>edit:
Edit a current team.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details">Details</h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">npm team</code> always operates directly on the current registry, configurable from
the command line using <code class="highlighter-rouge">--registry=&lt;registry url&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>In order to create teams and manage team membership, you must be a <em>team admin</em>
under the given organization. Listing teams and team memberships may be done by
any member of the organizations.</p>

<p>Organization creation and management of team admins and <em>organization</em> members
is done through the website, not the npm CLI.</p>

<p>To use teams to manage permissions on packages belonging to your organization,
use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm access</code> command to grant or revoke the appropriate permissions.</p>

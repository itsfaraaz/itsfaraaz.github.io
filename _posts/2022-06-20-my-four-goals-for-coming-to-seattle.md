I feel like I’ve always been a confident person, but January 2022 to around end of April 2022 I really started to feel like complete shit. This was mostly cause of this thing I was part of which kinda took over my life. I kind of stopped working out completely towards the end and ate like shit the entire time.
Fast forward to June 2022, i’m right now booling in seattle in my little studio in South Lake Union reflecting on how these last few weeks have been. I had four goals i wanted to accomplish before leaving back home to Philly:

1. Become confident again
2. Start working out & get back on the health grind
3. Become extroverted
4. Feel creative

Tbh my confidence is closely related to my workout schedule and eating habits. Idk if that’s a good or bad thing. But if I don’t work out or eat like shit I’ll also feel like shit. Being confident is like the basis of ur life I feel like. Without confidence it’s very hard to do anything because it’ll hinder everything. Now that i’ve been working out every day and eating healthy once again, my confidence has resurrected in that department.

I also realized that I had just became boring and introverted af these last few months. Not sure why but maybe because I kind of settled. Not saying that being introverted is a bad thing, but myself I had never been introverted really. I stopped going out and doing stuff and just wanted to lay in bed all day. Coming to Seattle forced me to get out of my comfort zone and talk to new people. After all, i came here with zero friends and needed to make some or else I’d be hella bored all day. Meeting all these new people and making some really cool friends has also brought my mood back up. Honestly I thought I’d hate going to the office but I actually love going in and seeing new people. I look forward to mondays because I just love being around a bunch of people and talking about random shit. I now wanna do stuff every day and get to know/meet more people.

Not being creative is boring (imo). But honestly I stopped being creative like a year ago. Now i’m tryna get back into different channels of media to express my creativity. Honestly at first i didn’t know why i started this blog, but it’s just another way I can show my creativity. What I write, how i design the website, the colors i use, the fonts, the pages… these are all the creative elements that are part of my vision.
Am I excited to go back to Philly? Eh. Not really honestly. Do I like Seattle tho? No. It’s expensive af and has mid food. I think I need some change in Philly. Too much of the same. I’m desperately looking for a new place because I want to move out of my current one to feel “fresh”.

Ok that’s all for this one. good bye papis ❤️ - fk

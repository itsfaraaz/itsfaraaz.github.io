some times i meet someone and something instantly clicks. we vibe super hard, laugh, share a bunch of memories, and grow together.

since highschool i‚Äôve been fortunate to make several friends like this. some of these people became part of my daily routine and really became my family.

however, as we grow and circumstances change, the dynamic of these friendships also change.

someone might move away. people create new relationships with others. people‚Äôs priorities change. people grow out of each other. sometimes people just change. and so these family like friendships fade away. and that always makes me very sad.

i feel like i experience this every once in a while. but all you can do is accept it. life moves on. maybe you'll reconnect in the future. but it sucks, and everyone experiences it. it's just something i thought a lot about this last week so thot i'd share.

till next time üôèüèΩ - fk

Heyo 🕺🏽

Welcome to my blog :)

Honestly, I don’t know why I created this. I am currently bored af @ work in Seattle and thought it would be cool to start something lilke this. Honestly, I don’t expect anyone to read this (maybe my girlfriend will?). It’s kind of a personal journal of a bunch of thoughts I have.

Fun fact—I actually hate reading/writing. I like videos so much better. But I feel like writing is somewhat therapeutic? My friend Hovni has been telling me my attention span is short af. I feel like writing on here will allow me to maybe clear my mind and work on that a little more.

Oh also, btw: don’t expect this blog to be super formal. I am literally writing this on my phone while I walk to Amazon Go to get some food lol. So, I apologize if it reads like a text message. I don’t know when I’ll post on here and what so let’s see what comes from it.

Okay bye papi’s
